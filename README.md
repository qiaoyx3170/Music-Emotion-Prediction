### Music Emotion Prediction
Assignment for the course Audio and Music Processing Lab

Predict arousal and valence values of music with different models.

There are 6 pre-trained models. They are trained on [DEAM](https://cvml.unige.ch/databases/DEAM/ and [EmoMusic](https://cvml.unige.ch/databases/emoMusic/) dataset, with three types of deep embeddings ([AudioSet-VGGish](https://essentia.upf.edu/models.html#audioset-vggish), [Discogs-EffNet](https://essentia.upf.edu/models.html#discogs-effnet), and [MSD-MusiCNN](https://essentia.upf.edu/models.html#msd-musicnn))

Finally, load annotation values of each music in the Spotify's API, and compare the annotation and the predicted values.
